NAME
    Test::XML - Compare XML in perl tests

SYNOPSIS
      use Test::XML tests => 3;
      is_xml_in_order( '<foo /><foo />', '<foo></foo><foo x="a"/>' );   # PASS
      is_xml_in_order( '<foo /><bar />', '<bar /><foo />' );       # FAIL
      isnt_xml_in_order( '<foo /><bar />', '<bar /><foo />' );     # PASS

DESCRIPTION
    This module contains generic XML testing tools. See below for a list of
    other modules with functions relating to specific XML modules.

FUNCTIONS
    is_xml_in_order ( GOT, EXPECTED [, TESTNAME ] )
        This function compares GOT and EXPECTED, both of which are strings
        of XML. The comparison works only on the order of the tags,
        attributes are ignored.

        Returns true or false, depending upon test success.

    isnt_xml_in_order( GOT, MUST_NOT_BE [, TESTNAME ] )
        This function is similar to is_xml(), except that it will fail if
        GOT and MUST_NOT_BE are identical.
